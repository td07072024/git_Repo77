In the mid-1960s, the NYSE Composite Index (NYSE: NYA) was created, with a base value of 50 points equal to the 1965 yearly close.[51] This was done to reflect the value of all stocks trading at the exchange, in contrast with the then predominant Dow Jones Industrial Average which tracks just 30 stocks. To raise the profile of the composite index, in 2003, the NYSE set its new base value of 5,000 points equal to the 2002 yearly close. Its close at the end of 2013 was 10,400.32.

Merger, acquisition, and control

On February 15, 2011, NYSE and Deutsche Börse announced their merger to form a new company, as yet unnamed, wherein Deutsche Börse shareholders would have 60% ownership of the new entity, and NYSE Euronext shareholders would have 40%.

On February 1, 2012, the European Commission blocked the merger of NYSE with Deutsche Börse, after commissioner Joaquín Almunia stated that the merger "would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide".[75] Instead, Deutsche Börse and NYSE would have to sell either their Eurex derivatives or LIFFE shares in order to not create a monopoly. On February 2, 2012, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed to scrap the merger.[76]

In April 2011, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an American futures exchange, and NASDAQ OMX Group had together made an unsolicited proposal to buy NYSE Euronext for approximately US$11,000,000,000, a deal in which NASDAQ would have taken control of the stock exchanges.[77] NYSE Euronext rejected this offer twice, but it was finally terminated after the United States Department of Justice indicated their intention to block the deal due to antitrust concerns.[77]

In December 2012, ICE had proposed to buy NYSE Euronext in a stock swap with a valuation of $8 billion.[8][77] NYSE Euronext shareholders would receive either $33.12 in cash, or $11.27 in cash and approximately a sixth of a share of ICE. Jeffrey Sprecher, the chairman and CEO of ICE, will retain those positions, but four members of the NYSE board of directors will be added to the ICE board.[8]

On January 24, 2023, a glitch in NYSE caused panic due to unintentional trade orders opened and closed in more than 250 securities.[78]

Opening and closing bells

The NYSE's opening and closing bells mark the beginning and the end of each trading day. The opening bell is rung at 9:30 am ET to mark the start of the day's trading session. At 4 pm ET the closing bell is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed.[79] There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of the trading day, is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a single-stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence. A third, red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring.[80]

The ringing of the bells usually accompanied with applause and is often done by VIPs and celebrities (See pictures and the section "Notable bell-ringers").

History
The signal to start and stop trading was not always a bell; a gavel was the original signal, which is still utilized alongside the bell. However, the gavel is frequently damaged. During the late 1800s, the NYSE decided to switch the gavel for a gong to signal the day's beginning and end. After the NYSE changed to its present location at 18 Broad Street in 1903, the gong was switched to the bell format that is currently being used. The bell itself was produced by Bevin Brothers in East Hampton, Connecticut, which is known colloquially as "Bell Town" for its history of bell foundries and metal toy manufacturing.

A common sight today is the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or executive from a corporation stands behind the NYSE podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring. Due to the amount of coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives ring the bell. It was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis; prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.[79]

Notable bell-ringers
Many of the people who ring the bell are business executives whose companies trade on the exchange, usually to announce new products, acquisitions, mergers or public offerings. However, there have also been many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell, such as the Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani and the President of South Africa Nelson Mandela. Two United Nations Secretaries General have also rung the bell. On April 27, 2006, Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the opening bell to launch the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.[81] On July 24, 2013, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to celebrate the NYSE joining the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.[82]

Celebrities that have rung the bell include athletes such as Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees and Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, entertainers such as rapper Snoop Dogg, members of ESPN's College GameDay crew, singer and actress Liza Minnelli[83] and members of the rock band Kiss.

In addition there have been many bell-ringers selected for their public contributions, such as members of the New York City Police Department and New York City Fire Department following the September 11 attacks, members of the United States Armed Forces serving overseas, and participants in various charitable organizations.

Several fictional characters have rung the bell as well, including Mickey Mouse, the Pink Panther, Mr. Potato Head, the Aflac Duck, Gene and Jailbreak of The Emoji Movie,[84] and Darth Vader.[85]
