Building
The main New York Stock Exchange Building, built in 1903, is at 18 Broad Street, between the corners of Wall Street and Exchange Place, and was designed in the Beaux Arts style by George B. Post.[37] The adjacent structure at 11 Wall Street, completed in 1922, was designed in a similar style by Trowbridge & Livingston. The buildings were both designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978.[38][39][40] 18 Broad Street is also a New York City designated landmark.[41]
